An attempt at a small, simple F# graphics library written on top of OpenGL, using the OpenTK bindings. This repository also contains a test implementation of two-player Pong.

The plan was to eventually provide a typed DSL for declaratively expressing the whole graphics pipeline, including the shaders. I started this work, but never finished. I don't recommend trying to use this.
